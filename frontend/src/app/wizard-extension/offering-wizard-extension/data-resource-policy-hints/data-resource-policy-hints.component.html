          You must define machine readable policies for the Data Resource as expected by Gaia-X and POSSIBLE-X.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use under Service Offering “POSSIBLE-X enforced policy” to restrict booking of this Data Service Offering by a consumer organisation in the POSSIBLE-X Dataspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              The policies for Data Resources are not technically enforced in the POSSIBLE-X Dataspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              A consumer organisation booking the Data Service Offering shall comply to those policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tip : Add those policies in human readable form under the T&Cs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compatible IT systems could automatically technically enforce them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          You may define 3 types of policies: prohibitions, permissions, obligations for the Data Resource.
          <br><br>
          The policies related to the Service providing the Data Resource (e.g. the use of an Eclipse Dataspace Connector) shall be defined in the next section.
          <br><br>
          For each policy type, you may take the following dimensions into account:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Access control</b>: Who is allowed to access this Data Resource? (e.g. only certain departments or roles)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Usage control</b>: How may the Data Resource be used? (e.g. only for internal analyses, not to be passed on to third parties, pre-requisites to be fullfilled to use the data)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Security</b>: What security precautions need to be taken? (e.g. encryption, regular security checks)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data retention</b>: How long should the data be retained and when should it be deleted? (e.g. retention for 5 years, then secure deletion)
            </li>
          </ul>
