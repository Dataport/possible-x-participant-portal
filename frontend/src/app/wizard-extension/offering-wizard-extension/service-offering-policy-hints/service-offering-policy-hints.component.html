          You must define machine readable policies for the Service Offering as expected by Gaia-X and POSSIBLE-X.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use under Service Offering “POSSIBLE-X enforced policy” to restrict booking of this Data Service Offering by a consumer organisation in the POSSIBLE-X Dataspace.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other policies for Service Offerings are not technically enforced in the POSSIBLE-X Dataspace
            </li>
            <li>
              A consumer organisation booking the (Data) Service Offering shall comply to those policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tip : Add all Service Offering policies in human readable form under the T&Cs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compatible IT systems could automatically technically enforce them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          You may define 3 types of policies: prohibitions, permissions, obligations for the Service Offering.
          <br><br>
          For each of them, you may take the following dimensions into account:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Access control</b>: Who is allowed to interact with the service or specific functions? (e.g. only certain organisation, departments or roles to use a function, book the service, etc..)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Please note that the policy list in the Data Resource / Service Offering description will automatically include the “POSSIBLE-X enforced policy”  if you select and configure it in the next section.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Terms of use / Usage control</b>: Under what conditions may the service be used? (e.g. only or not for specific purposes, if a pre-condition/a obligation is (not) met, with a defined frequency, at specific time windows etc.. )
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Security</b>: What security precautions need to be taken? (e.g. use of VPNs, two-factor authentication)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Logging and monitoring</b>: How is the use of the service logged and monitored? (e.g. regular review of transmission logs must be done)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data integrity</b>: What obligations has the user to comply to ensure the integrity of the data input/output to/from the service? (e.g. maintain integrity proofs of data input like checksums, error correction procedures, protect data output received from the service)
            </li>
