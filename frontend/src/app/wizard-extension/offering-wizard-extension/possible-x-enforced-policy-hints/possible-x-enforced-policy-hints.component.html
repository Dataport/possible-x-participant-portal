            <li>
              “Restrict the contractual booking to organization(s)” allows to restrict which organization(s) of your choice will be able to proceed with a contractual booking based on their legal participant did:web declared in the POSSIBLE-X Catalogue credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Restrict contract duration - set start date” allows to restrict the start date of the contract. Contractual booking and transfers will be possible only after the start date.*
