# POSSIBLE-X Participant Portal Backend

The backend component of the POSSIBLE-X Participant Portal is a Spring Boot application that provides the REST API for
the frontend. It manages interactions with the participant's EDC and the central POSSIBLE-X Catalogue / Fraunhofer (FH)
Catalog to consume and provide Service Offerings / Data Service Offerings. It also allows looking up the contracts that
the user has closed in the POSSIBLE-X Dataspace.

The Participant Portal backend is supposed to be used in conjunction with
an [EDC Connector](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector) in the version `v0.4.1` and with
the [IONOS S3 Extension](https://github.com/Digital-Ecosystems/edc-ionos-s3/) in version `v2.2.0`.

### prefill-fields.data-service-offering.json-file-path

Provide the path to a JSON file for prefilling data service offering fields. This allows easy configuration of prefill
texts for different use cases.

Currently, the JSON file should contain the following fields:

```
{
  "serviceOfferingName": "Title",
  "serviceOfferingDescription": "Description"
}
```

It is possible to add a placeholder `<Data resource name>` in the `serviceOfferingName` and `serviceOfferingDescription`
fields that would be replaced with the data resource name in the frontend.

If no file path is provided or the file cannot be found, a default JSON file with default values is used.

## Build

If you only want to build the project, you can go to the root of the repository and run

```
./gradlew buildBackend
```

after which the built jar can be found at `backend/build/libs/backend-x.y.z.jar`.

## Run

The configuration options mentioned above can be set via environment variables as needed.
Below are some examples, please replace the right hand side with the actual values.

```
export EDC_XAPIKEY="EDC X-API-Key"
export EDC_MGMTBASEURL="EDC management URL"
export FH_CATALOG_REPO_URL="Fraunhofer catalogue URL to piveau-hub-repo"
export FH_CATALOG_SPARQL_URL="Fraunhofer catalogue URL to the SPARQL interface of Virtuoso"
export FH_CATALOG_SECRETKEY="secret key"
export SDCREATIONWIZARDAPI_BASEURL="SD Creation Wizard API base URL"
export PARTICIPANTID="participant ID"
export PREFILLFIELDS_DATASERVICEOFFERING_JSONFILEPATH="File Path"
```

Through gradle:

```
./gradlew startBackend
```

Alternatively running the jar directly (if built previously):

```
java -jar backend/build/libs/backend-x.y.z.jar
```

Once the service is running, you can access it at http://localhost:8080/ .
